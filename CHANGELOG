## [2.1.55] - 2021-03-26
### Added
- varnish-admin service that proxy-caches the fuseki-admin triplestore
- `purge_backend_cache` function to the HTTP test runner script run.sh
- `purge_backend_cache` calls to clear proxy caches before each HTTP script
- `BackendInvalidationFilter` response filter with backend proxy cache invalidation heuristics
- Basic environment variable documentation to README

### Changed
- Upgraded Processor and Web-Client to the latest versions
- Upgraded Saxon-JS to 2.1
- End-user and admin Services passed to import `Executor` instead of `DatasetAccessor`
- Defined HTTP method -> ACL mode mapping as the `AuthorizationFilter.ACCESS_MODES` map

### Removed
- Unused Docker mounts from linkeddatahub service
- `ban()` calls from `ResourceBase` -- now handled by the `BackendInvalidationFilter`

## [2.1.49] - 2021-03-19
### Added
- `apl:baseUri` as a static XSLT stylesheet param

### Changed
- `bs2:PropertyControl` XSLT mode can handle multiple RDF types on a resource
- Replaced error alerts with inline HTML warning blocks
- `Refactored bs2:SignUp template to make it more extensible`

### Removed
- `ORDER BY` in `apl:ResultCounts` mode in client.xsl

## [2.1.28] - 2021-03-06
### Added
- `$request_base` parameter support in scripts allows to use a base URI for HTTP requests which is different from the RDF dataset base URI. Useful when multiple LDH instances on different domains or port numbers are backed by the same dataset. E.g. one with WebID-TLS auth enabled and the other without.
- Dydra-specific `QuadStoreClient` and `GraphStoreClient` with support for [asynchonous GSP requests](https://api.dydra.com/graphstore/asynchronous.html)

### Changed
- Ontology classes that used to be in the `ns:` namespace (`${base}ns#`) moved to `nsds:` (`${base}ns/domain/system#`)
- Ontology classes that used to be in the `def:` namespace (`${base}def#`) moved to `nsdd:` (`${base}ns/domain/default#`)
- `python` usages replaced with `python2` in CLI scripts
- Mounting only `ssl/owner/public.pem` instead of the whole `ssl/owner` folder which includes the private key

### Removed
- Expensive join with the provenance graph from the `laclt:ConstructAgentItem` query. As a result, `dct:created` value is not included in agent's description.
- Unnecessary methods from the `Import` Java interface. Passing arguments directly to `ImportListener` instead
