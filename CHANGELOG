## [2.2.9] - 2021-04-22
### Added
- HTTP smoke tests for SPARQL endpoint and Graph Store
- HTTP test for RDF import without mapping query
- `add-data.sh` CLI script which POSTs RDF data to URL
- `ExceptionMapper` constructors with injection in order to align with Processor
- An option to override request URI using the `?uri=` URL param, implemented in `ApplicationFilter`
- `Dispatcher` as the new "entrypoint" JAX-RS resource which routes between `ResourceBase` (if app is not empty) and `ProxyResourceBase` (if app is empty)
- Missing XML namespace definitions to client-side XSLT stylesheets
- `$output-json-ld` parameter in `xhtml:Script` template which outputs the RDF document as JSON-LD in the `<script>` element

### Changed
- `select-labelled` query in the end-user dataset to include a default graph pattern
- `spin:query` property is now optional for `apl:RDFImport`
- Entrypoint script logic to load agent metadata only when `$LOAD_DATASETS` is true
- Injecting `Optional<Application>`, `Optional<Service>`, `Optional<Ontology>` instead of `Application`, `Service`, `Ontology`
- Using `javax.inject.Provider<>` for injection into providers that are not in the request scope
- If no application matches request URI, `NotFoundException` is not thrown anymore -- `Optional.empty()` is used as application instead
- Auth filters skipped if the matched application is not an instance of `lapp:EndUserApplication` or `lapp:AdminApplication`
- Simplified `ResourceBase::describe` by removing the `?uri=` indirection logic

### Removed
- Proxy injections from injection factory binders


## [2.1.49] - 2021-03-19
### Added
- `apl:baseUri` as a static XSLT stylesheet param

### Changed
- `bs2:PropertyControl` XSLT mode can handle multiple RDF types on a resource
- Replaced error alerts with inline HTML warning blocks
- Refactored `bs2:SignUp` template to make it more extensible

### Removed
- `ORDER BY` in `apl:ResultCounts` mode in client.xsl

## [2.1.28] - 2021-03-06
### Added
- `$request_base` parameter support in scripts allows to use a base URI for HTTP requests which is different from the RDF dataset base URI. Useful when multiple LDH instances on different domains or port numbers are backed by the same dataset. E.g. one with WebID-TLS auth enabled and the other without.
- Dydra-specific `QuadStoreClient` and `GraphStoreClient` with support for [asynchonous GSP requests](https://api.dydra.com/graphstore/asynchronous.html)

### Changed
- Ontology classes that used to be in the `ns:` namespace (`${base}ns#`) moved to `nsds:` (`${base}ns/domain/system#`)
- Ontology classes that used to be in the `def:` namespace (`${base}def#`) moved to `nsdd:` (`${base}ns/domain/default#`)
- `python` usages replaced with `python2` in CLI scripts
- Mounting only `ssl/owner/public.pem` instead of the whole `ssl/owner` folder which includes the private key

### Removed
- Expensive join with the provenance graph from the `laclt:ConstructAgentItem` query. As a result, `dct:created` value is not included in agent's description.
- Unnecessary methods from the `Import` Java interface. Passing arguments directly to `ImportListener` instead
