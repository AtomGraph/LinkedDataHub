        See <a href="usage/">Getting started</a> guide for basic definitions such as application and document.</p>
    <div class="alert alert-info">
        <p>User interface is only one of the interfaces LinkedDataHub provides. The other one is the <a href="command-line-interface">
            Command line interface</a>, which supports most of the UI actions.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="alert alert-info">
        <p><em>Note that user interface features are subject to <a href="administration/acl">access control</a>. For example,
            the search box will be visible if the user is not authorized to access the search container.</em></p>

        <p>The application title or logo in the top-left always links to the root container of the current application.</p>
        <p><dfn>Search box</dfn> lets users <a href="usage/#search" title="Search action">search for resources</a>
        within the current application that have the specified keyword in their titles, descriptions etc. User can
        navigate the search results just like any other container.</p>
        <p>Application's <dfn>SPARQL endpoint</dfn> is accessible on the right. It offers a query editor and a result
        view. Learn more about query possibilities in the <a href="usage/query-data">Query data</a> section.</p>
        <p>Current application can be switched using a dropdown on the right. Different users have access to
        different applications, depending on their authorizations.</p>
        <p>Currently <a href="getting-started#log-in" title="Log in">logged-in user's</a> account is accessible via the icon on
            the right, which opens a drop-down. You can log out by clicking the <span class="btn">Logout</span> button.</p>

            <p><em>Due to current web browser limitations, it is not possible to logout using client certificate authentication.

        <p>The <span class="btn">Create</span> button invokes <a href="#create-edit">create dialog</a> through which
        resources can be <a href="usage/#create">created</a> as instances of the
        <a href="administration/model/#classes">classes</a> defined in the model.</p>
        <p>The path leading from the current document up the parent/child hierarchy to the root container is shown in
        the <dfn>breadcrumb bar</dfn>, where the current document is always the last breadcrumb. The user can always
        open any of the ascendant containers by clicking breadcrumbs left from the current one. The icon shows the
        type of the current document (container or item).</p>
        <p>Further to the left, the action bar displays a number of buttons for toggling the available
        <a href="#layout-modes">layout modes</a> as well as <a href="usage/#manage">performing actions</a> on the
        current document.</p>

        <h2 id="layout-modes">Layout modes</h2>
        <p>A list of possible <dfn>layout modes</dfn> is displayed, and can be switched using, the mode dropdown in
        the action bar. Containers and items are available in different modes.</p>
        <p>Container (page) layout modes:</p>
        <dl>
            <dt>Properties</dt>
            <dd>The most detailed view showing every property/value of children resources.</dd>
            <dt>List</dt>
            <dd>List of children resources with titles and descriptions.</dd>
            <dt>Table</dt>
            <dd>Table with children resources as rows, properties as columns, and values as cells</dd>
            <dt>Grid</dt>
            <dd>A grid of children resources with titles, descriptions, and depiction thumbnails, if any.</dd>
            <dt>Map</dt>
            <dd>Shows all topic resources of the children of the current container that have coordinates</dd>
            <dt>Graph</dt>

        <dl>
            <dt>Properties</dt>

            if any.</dd>
            <dt>Map</dt>
            <dd>Shows all topic resources of the children of the current container that have coordinates.</dd>
            <dd>If the topic of current document is on the map, its description will be displayed in an info

            <dt>Graph</dt>
            <dd>Displays the current document and related resources graphically as nodes in a network using

        </dl>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2 id="pagination">Pagination</h2>
        <p>Pagination is only available for container resources. <span class="btn">Prev</span>/<span class="btn">Next</span>
        pager buttons, located above and below the <a href="#main-content">main content</a>, link to the page before
        the current one and after the current one, respectively.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2 id="main-content">Main content</h2>
        <p>The main content section is located in the center of the screen. Its contents depend on the current document
        and the current layout mode. Layout modes can be switched in the <a href="#action-bar">action bar</a>.</p>
        <p>For containers, its children resources (normally a page of them) are shown. The default layout is
        <a href="#layout-modes">list</a>.</p>
        <p>For items, its XHTML content and properties/values of its topic resource (if any) are shown. The default
        layout is <a href="#layout-modes">properties</a>.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2 id="left-nav">Left navigation</h2>
        <p>The left-side navigation provides access to the first-level children of the
            <a href="usage/#hierarchy">root container</a>.</p>
        <p>Depending on the type of the current container, a faceted search that filters its children using combinations
        of subclass types can also be shown.</p>
        <p>At the bottom of this section you will find quick access links to the following system containers:</p>
        <dl>
          <dt>Latest</dt>
          <dd>A container with the latest resources in the application's dataset by creation/modification date</dd>
          <dt>Files</dt>
          <dd>A container for <a href="usage/#files">file uploads</a></dd>
          <dt>Imports</dt>
          <dd>A container for <a href="usage/import-data">data imports</a></dd>
          <dt>Queries</dt>
          <dd>A container for end-user SPARQL queries (including <a href="usage/import-data#vocabulary-conversion">vocabulary
              mappings</a>)</dd>
          <dt>Geo</dt>
          <dd>A container with all resources in the application's dataset that have geographic coordinates</dd>
          <dt>Charts</dt>
          <dd>A container with charts that visualize SPARQL query results</dd>
        </dl>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2 id="right-nav">Right navigation</h2>
        <p>The right-side navigation shows details of the current document, such as creator and creation/modification
        date. Additionally, it can show contextual links depending on the type of current document.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2 id="create-edit">Create/Edit dialog</h2>
        <p>
            <img alt="Create/Edit dialog" src="uploads/fa4ec808c4dca4fe6b5a610d3e028ad48f8ed9af"></img>
        </p>
        <p>Resources are <a href="usage/#create">created</a> and <a href="usage/#update">updated</a> using
        the same form-based dialog. The form can display either a document alone, or a document paired with its topic resource.
        Each resource is displayed in a separate fieldset; fieldsets are nested for related resources.</p>
        <p>Properties are listed inside fieldsets and their values shown as user inputs. When creating or updating a
        resource which type class is defined in the <a href="administration/model/">model</a>, resource
        properties are specified by the <a href="administration/model/#constructors">class constructor</a>.
        Values of object properties are be displayed as typeahead input allowing users to type keywords and select
        matching resources from a dropdown list. The list is filtered by resource type specified in the constructor.
        Typeahead inputs also allow absolute URI values.</p>
        <p>Mandatory properties are those for which there exists a <a href="administration/model/#constraints">constraint</a>
        on a class that is being created or edited. Mandatory properties do not have a remove button. New property with a value
        can be added using the property dropdown (at the bottom of fieldset).</p>
        <p>If any of the resources are invalid (because of URI syntax errors or constraint violations) when attempting
        to save the data, you will see error messages and indications which values are invalid. Resource creation or
        update cannot be performed until these errors are fixed.</p>
