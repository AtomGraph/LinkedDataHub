============================

The project welcomes contributions, large and small, from anyone.

The mailing list for project-wide discussions is linkeddatahub@groups.io.

## Contributions

Documentation is kept and published via a git repository:

## Workflow

### Github issues

The project uses GitHub issues to track work. Please create a GitHub issue so that we can track a contribution:

    https://github.com/AtomGraph/LinkedDataHub/issues

### Legal

You, as an individual, must be entitled to make the contribution to the
project. If the contribution is part of your employment, please arrange
this before making the contribution.

For a large contribution, the project may ask for a specific Software
Grant from the contributor.

If in doubt, or if you have any questions, ask on the linkeddatahub@groups.io
mailing list. Legal issues are easier to deal with if done before
contributing, rather than after.

The project cannot accept contributions with unclear ownership nor
contributions containing work by other people without a clear agreement
from those people.
