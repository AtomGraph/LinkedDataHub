without Tentris´s prior written consent.

### 10.3.

only to the extent that it is in contravention of applicable laws without invalidating the remaining provisions of the

collaboration under this EULA.

its assets not involving a competitor of the other Party. In the event of an assignment as described in the
preceding sentence, the assigning Party shall provide the other Party with written notice of the assignment. Neither
Party may assign this EULA to a competitor of the other Party without that other Party’s consent. Subject to the
foregoing, this EULA will bind and inure to the benefit of the Parties, their respective successors and permitted
